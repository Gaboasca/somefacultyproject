		<p>Nelo is designed to make the task of finding a traveling destination to be as easy as walking down street . It does this providing common ground for hotels and tourist to find each other. </p>
	<p>The first time you access the Nelo website, you are prezented with  a multitude of hotels from different areas across Romania.  If you are in a hurry you can make a booking right away, after you decide in which hotel you wold like to stay. You can make a booking if the hotel has empty rooms in the period that you select, if that particular hotel has no more rooms you will be provided with other locations in the vicinity that have a empty room or the earliest date that that particular hotel has empty rooms. After you are happy with the hotel  and  date you click the “Register ” button. Becauser you  do not have an account we do not record the transaction, we send an email to you and one to the  hotel’s email address. </p>
	<p>For the user that plans his/hers family vacation we provide the possibility to register an account and give them extended options.  On the left right corner you have a drop down list that provides a link to the register page. We ask the user for basic information in order to validate and remember them and their transactions. You can edit your account settings, view the booking that you made so far, the ones that are in  future and the ones the you already have passed.
	You can search for hotels, dates, a specific budget  , the number of room or all af  these. After the result are returned, you cand see the detail of a hotel that you like by clicking on the hotels imaage card. There you will find more pictures, reviews and much more.</p>

	<p>The second part of our website are the services that we offer to hotels. To appear on our website you need to make an acount and provide us with photos , a short description and other details. Once you made an account you cant delete it for six moths.
What makes us differ is the fact that we provide the option of overbooking.If you choose the overbooking option in the first 3 months we will gather data from how, who comes and goes and for how long are they staying. After that we accept a mumber of rezervations that exeeds the number of rooms that you have to counter for no shows(made a booking but did not show up). This will be done acording to the data that we colect</p>
 <p>The payment is made at the end of your stay at the hotel that you chose.</p>

<p>Disclamer!
Our services are free and we do not take any reponsability for guests that do not show or hotels that do not over good serveces.
